This library has no intentions.

On development. The purpose of 'RPG Manager' is to be a 'manager' to a RPG like D&D that i was invited and challenged to write a program to help-me on this task. I will let all the code open to receive feedback and if you want to test it, feel free to do.

RPG Manager contains:
*Input Player system
*Player stats
*Dices (D20, D6) generator
*Round creator (with turn order by highest number on D20 to lowest)
*History progress viewer
